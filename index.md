### What is OCR?

Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the **electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten, or printed text into machine-encoded text**, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo (for example the text on signs and billboards in a landscape photo) or from subtitle text superimposed on an image (for example: from a television broadcast).

_The Vision framework allows the users to apply computer vision algorithms to perform a variety of tasks on input images and video._

_About
Developed this app to easily extract code snippets from youtube tutorials which do not have a git link. Watching and typing becomes a tedious task at times. Anyways the repo name suggests it all. Live proj. Some commits might produce bugs._

### Code block
```
1. Import Vision framework.
import vision
2. Add access to camera/photos so the user can click/select images for character recognition. Make sure to add the necessary permissions in info.plist
